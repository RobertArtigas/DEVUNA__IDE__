# DEVUNA__IDE__
DEVUNA directory arranged as a Clarion IDE set of directories. All that has been done, is a compile of the existing sources using 
the RED file provided that points to the LibSrc and Template directories for these specific applications. Everything is issolated 
in it's own directories so you do not have to add all the DEVUNA classes and templates into your common Clarion directories.

The KiSS application directory is Mr. Mark Riffey's sources with all his changes. The Class Viewer application directory 
is currently the version from the DEVUNA directory (there will be some changes later).

If you need the original sources to start with, download the current directory structure, get it to compile. Then get the original sources 
from the DEVUNA directories, put it in the correct place for your specific compile directory structure, and and then do your compiles.

## Compile directory path

Disk Drive Compiler Directory Path: **C:\\\_GIT\_\\Devuna\\\_\_IDE\_\_\\\***

That is the compile directory path that is being used to compile the applications on the disk drive. 

You will have to adjust the RED file being used for your specific compile paths.
