# DEVUNA__IDE__
DEVUNA directory arranged as a Clarion IDE set of directories. What has been done, is a compile of the existing sources using 
the RED file provided that points to the LibSrc and Template directories for these specific applications. Everything is issolated 
in it's own directories so you do not have to add all the DEVUNA classes and templates into your common Clarion directories.

The KiSS application directory is Mr. Mark Riffey's sources with all his changes. The Class Viewer application directory 
is currently the sources from the DEVUNA directory (there will be some changes later).

If you need the original sources to start with, download the current directory structure, get it to compile. Then get the original sources 
from the DEVUNA directories, put it in the correct place for your specific compile directory structure, and then do your compiles.

## Compile directory path

Disk Drive Compiler Directory Path: **C:\\\_GIT\_\\Devuna\\\_\_IDE\_\_\\\***

That above location is the compile directory path that is being used to compile the applications on the disk drive.

Once you move into the application directory you will see the different application that are currenctly available.

In each application directory there is a local RED file that will be picked up by the IDE when you open the application.

You might have to adjust the RED file being used for your specific compile paths.
