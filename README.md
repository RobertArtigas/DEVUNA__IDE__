# DEVUNA__IDE__
**DEVUNA directory arranged as a Clarion IDE set of directories.** What has been done, is a compile of the existing sources using 
the RED file provided that points to the LibSrc and Template directories for these specific applications. Everything is issolated 
in it's own directories so you do not have to add all the [DEVUNA](https://github.com/Devuna) classes and templates into your common Clarion directories.

The KSS application directory is Mr. Mark Riffey's sources with all his changes. The Class Viewer application directory 
is currently the sources from the DEVUNA directory (there will be some changes later). 

<br/>_**This is my personal directory with changes to the original applications for the executable versions I use in my Clarion development.<br/><br/>
These are NOT the original sources.**_<br/><br/>

If you need the original sources to start with, download the current directory structure, get it to compile. Then get the original sources 
from the [DEVUNA](https://github.com/Devuna) directories, put it in the correct place for your specific compile directory structure, and then do your compiles.

May you have good fortune with all your learning experiences.

## Compile directory path

Disk Drive Compiler Directory Path: **C:\\\_GIT\_\\Devuna\\\_\_IDE\_\_\\\***

That above location is the compile directory path that is being used to compile the applications on the disk drive.<br/><br/><br/>

<BR/>Above you are viewing the directory structure of the GitHub directory on my development machine.<br/><br/><br/>

## C:\\\_GIT\_\\Devuna\\\_\_IDE\_\_\\Application

<BR/>Once you move into the application directory you will see the different applications that are currently available.<br/><br/><br/>

## C:\\\_GIT\_\\Devuna\\\_\_IDE\_\_\\Application\\KSS

<BR/>In each application directory there is a local RED file that will be picked up by the IDE when you open the application.
This is the specific KSS aplication directory.<br/><br/><br/>

## [RED]irection file

<BR/>Using the KSS application as an example I opened the RED file from the IDE and you can see that all there is an include the specfic RED file 
that is being used.<br/><br/><br/>

<BR/>**The RED entries that are used by the IDE that apply to the Devuna locations for my directory setup are shown above.** 
They point to were the class sources and templates are located so when the IDE opens it can find classes and templates. 
Please recall that you still have to register the templates from the specific directory location.

If you want to use your personal RED file, the entries will have to be copied from this RED file to your RED file, and your RED file directory locations changed 
for your Clarion IDE setup to where you have located your Devuna directories.

_There may be a couple of additional entries need in your RED file to pick up the images that are for each application that are location in
each specific image directory for that application._<br/><br/><br/>

**I didn’t like all this mystery** business long before I ever did anything about it, and when I _did_ do something about it, I found that I was right, that all mystery is in the eye of the beholder and that we are free to stop seeing mystery whenever we decide to open our eyes and actually look. This is no small point. We have to look hard at this mystery business in order to get past it.<br/>
